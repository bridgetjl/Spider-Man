    <em><h3>Origin Story:</h3></em> When Peter was bitten he didn’t take his responsibility seriously at first. After the death of his Uncle Ben, at the hands of a robber Spider-Man had the opportunity to stop, he accepted his role and treated it carefully. His Uncle Ben was a huge inspiration to him and his very famous quote “With great power comes great responsibility”, fuels Peter’s motivation to fight crime.

    <em><h3>Movies:</h3></em> Peter Parker has been depicted in film by many different actors, most recently, Tom Holland. He is now portrayed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe along with other superheroes like Captain America and Iron Man and takes on enormous challenges like helping the Avengers to defeat Thanos. Through this journey, he himself has become an Avenger, after being taken under the wing of Tony Stark.

    <em><h3>Normal Life:</h3></em> Although he is extremely busy with superhero activities, Peter makes time for his normal life. He, unlike many other heroes, chooses to keep his identity a secret in order to protect his family from his many foes. This means that he has a relatively normal life on the side. He attended Midtown High School and is extremely gifted in math and science, even creating his own web fluid and suit at first. After high school he attended the fictional Empire State University and then went on to a job at The Daily Bugle, a fictional newspaper, as a photographer; although he continued to take jobs in math and science as well. His role as Spider-Man allowed him the opportunity to take pictures directly at the scene of each crime he defeated. One downside to this job, however, is that he worked for editor J. Jonah Jameson, a vocal Spider-Man critic who often attempts to turn the public against Spider-Man. Something Spider-Man’s enemies have been trying to do for years.

    <em><h3>Family:</h3></em> An important priority of Peter’s is protecting his family because he doesn’t have much left. Unfortunately, his parents died when he was very little and his Uncle Ben was killed by a robber.

    <h4>Mary Jane Watson:</h4> Mary Jane Watson or MJ is an extremely important character in the Spider-Man universe. She and Peter have a very serious on and off relationship throughout their lives and her life is often in danger because of Peter’s role as Spider-Man.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe MJ is changed to Michelle Jones, Peter's love interest who fills the role of MJ, but has very different qualities. She is very different from the orginal comic book character.
