    <h4>Mary Jane Watson:</h4> Mary Jane Watson or MJ is an extremely important character in the Spider-Man universe. She and Peter have a very serious on and off relationship throughout their lives and her life is often in danger because of Peter’s role as Spider-Man. Peter first disregards her as a flaky party girl, but he gets to know her much better when they bond following the death of Gwen Stacy. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe MJ is changed to Michelle Jones, Peter's love interest who fills the role of MJ, but has very different qualities. She is very different from the orginal comic book character.
